So, one of my passions is building my own gaming rigs. To the point, where I usually have parts lying around, and have been able to build a few additional towers on the side. Here are the specs to my latest:

* BitFenix Shinobi XL
* Intel i5 2500K
* MSI Z68A-GD55 motherboard
* 16 GB Patriot Viper Xtreme (1866mhz)
* 2 x MSI GeForce GTX 560 Ti
* Plextor 128Gb SSD M5 Pro Xtreme
* AData 120Gb SSD SandForce SF-2281
* WD 2Tb Caviar Green HD
* DasKeyboard Model S Professional
* Razer DeathAdder Black
* BenQ RL2450HT monitor
* SteelSeries Siberia V2 

My main platform for gaming, like most, is Steam. Considering the most recent announcement of the SteamOS, machines, and gamepad, being excited is pretty much a given. I won't dwell too much on a subject that has been dissected and discussed at length across the inter-webs, but will say that I am really interested to see the level of customization available, and possibly being rid of Windows once and for all!

I suppose I would have to say that two of my favorite game developers are Ubisoft and Valve. Huge fan of the Prince of Persia, Assassin's Creed, Portal, and Half-Life series. The Bioshock series is also pretty damned awesome.

If anyone needs a friend on Steam for the hardware beta, I go by the handle 'quandrei'.  Just ping me.

L8r!
