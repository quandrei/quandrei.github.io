So I've decided to make the transition from SquareSpace to [github pages](http://pages.github.com/).

There are a few reasons for this:

* gh-pages is available for the low, bargain-basement price of free as opposed to SS costing money
* gh-pages allows me to version-control my site -- being an avid developer, this appeals to me
* gh-pages has the basic features I need -- all I really do is put up links to my projects and blog, and gh-pages allows me to do this easily. SS offers many more features, like e-commerce, but when unused, seems silly to pay for them
* the longer I stay with SS, the more difficult it will be to move away from them (i.e. move my content somewhere else, if I ever wish to leave)
* the UI in SS seems to be a bit more cumbersome lately, and is starting to annoy me

I will be moving my content gradually to my new digs: [quandrei.github.io](http://quandrei.github.io/)

[End transmission]
