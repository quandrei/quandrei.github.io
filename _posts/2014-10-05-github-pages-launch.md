So the process was slow­moving (due to a few other things going on in my life), but it is finally up and running. A few things to take note of:

###**Deciding on a Jekyll theme**

This was more challenging than I thought. There are quite a few out there, but I decided on one that was simple, and looked slick, namely, [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) (the Jekyll butler) using the [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) theme. [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) was a close second, but I preferred having the hidden menu.

###**The CSS is a bit buggy**

It does not seem to be completely cross­browser friendly. I noticed that clicking on the menu icon (top­right) in FF will still have the icon super­imposed on the text, whereas in other browsers, it will move left when displaying the menu (as it should). When using a fresh Jekyll install locally, with no content changed, this is not the case, but as soon as I changed something, it broke for some reason. It's possible I borked something somewhere, but haven't looked into it much. Funny enough, it works nicely on my Nexus 4 using the FF browser.

###**Moving Content**

Obviously, this was a little dull as I needed to grab the raw content from my SS site, and format it for markdown. SS doesn't have an API I'm aware of for such a task (although I didn't look into it much), and I probably could've written a script for this, but I would've needed to go through the content anyway to ensure everything was pristine. The script would've likely taken more time than actually going through the few blog posts I had.

###**A few nice things...**

There are a few easily­ done things I liked about SS. One was having a tag cloud, which requires some plugin for Jekyll. Not sure if having a plugin is something I could do on Github Pages, so I would need to look into it. Another, was having a gallery of some photography I did in a past life. Again, a plugin is the likely route, and not sure if gh­pages blah blah blah...
