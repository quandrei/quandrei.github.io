So I have been extraordinarily busy with work these past few months, and haven't had very much time for side projects, and interesting things that I've wanted to devote some time to. I've also been getting pretty bored with the work I am doing, something very dangerous in my profession, since this usually leads to the itch for new surroundings. This is a fairly engaging read on how to combat boredom for employees: [Bored People Quit](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/bored-people-quit/)

In an effort to combat my boredom, I have been devoting time to learning a few new things:

* [Dokku](http://progrium.viewdocs.io/dokku/) - PAAS (mini-Heroku) I deployed to my VPS to host everything
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) / [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - python microframework used to create a web app
* [Go](https://golang.org/) / [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) - golang site generator to provide info on various projects
* [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) - iOS app to interface with the web app API

I will update here, once more of these developments have materialized.
