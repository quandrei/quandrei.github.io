  What you are experiencing is a temporary distortion of reality. Do not be alarmed.

This is a home for all that is dev outside my regular gig as a software developer, with a few other interests peppered in. Formerly on [squarespace](http://squarespace.com/), I decided to move to github pages, and haven't looked back. If you're interested why, read [this](http://quandrei.github.io/2014/03/20/github-pages-transition/).

<strong>Setup for this site:</strong>

* Deployed using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a wicked static site generator
* Hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* Built using tools like [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Oh my ZSH](http://ohmyz.sh/), in between coffees
* Using [Poole](http://getpoole.com/), with [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) as a theme, developed by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo)
