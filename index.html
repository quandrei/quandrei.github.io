                  So I have been extraordinarily busy with work these past few months, and haven&rsquo;t had very much time for side projects, and interesting things that I&rsquo;ve wanted to devote some time to. I&rsquo;ve also been getting pretty bored with the work I am doing, something very dangerous in my profession, since this usually leads to the itch for new surroundings. This is a fairly engaging read on how to combat boredom for employees: Bored People Quit In an effort to combat my boredom, I have been devoting time to learning a few new things: Dokku - PAAS (mini-Heroku) I deployed to my VPS to host everything Python / Flask - python microframework used to create a web app Go / Hugo - golang site generator to provide info on various projects Swift - iOS app to interface with the web app API I will update here, once more of these developments have materialized.

                  I&rsquo;ve been working as a Magento developer for a little over a year and a half, and I have come to one inescapable conclusion; I am not enjoying this. Have you ever heard the expression: Stupid is as stupid does Well, by that same token, I think that the following expression is an apt decription of Magento: Magento is as Magento does For a more full explanation of the underlying expression, see this (you can ignore all the preachy comments, and stick to the first answer given).

                  Recently, I had been a little disappointed with the battery life on my Nexus 4 device. I noticed a drop in battery performance when I installed Android Lollipop, and thought the reason might be due to all the upgrades and bloat I had accumulated. I decided that what was needed was a tried and true method: a clean install. And this was the perfect opportunity to give a custom ROM a shot; specifically, CyanogenMod.

                  So, in preparations for a trip this summer, I had booked a few flights through the Royal Bank rewards program. The flight tickets are held by the Lufthansa airline, while one of the flights is operated by Air Canada (being one of their partners). An important piece of information to note, is that I will be traveling with an infant. That being the case, I wanted to reserve seats with a bassinet, and in the case of the Air Canada operated flight, this is in the preferred seating area (which carries with it a fee, that I am more than willing to pay).

                  With the release of OS-X Yosemite, I decided it was time for a clean install of my system. I decided that this time, I would try and automate this as much as possible, without having to resort to being there very much, because, well&hellip; time is precious and I have better things to do. The script and general steps I used can be found in a bash file I have on my github account.

                  So the process was slow­moving (due to a few other things going on in my life), but it is finally up and running. A few things to take note of: Deciding on a Jekyll theme This was more challenging than I thought. There are quite a few out there, but I decided on one that was simple, and looked slick, namely, Poole (the Jekyll butler) using the Lanyon theme. Hyde was a close second, but I preferred having the hidden menu.

                  So I&rsquo;ve decided to make the transition from SquareSpace to github pages. There are a few reasons for this: gh-pages is available for the low, bargain-basement price of free as opposed to SS costing money gh-pages allows me to version-control my site &ndash; being an avid developer, this appeals to me gh-pages has the basic features I need &ndash; all I really do is put up links to my projects and blog, and gh-pages allows me to do this easily.

                  So, let&rsquo;s start this off with a quote from my last post: There were many obstacles from the very beginning, including architectural design decisions, unclear specifications and requirements, and limited developer resources and experience for the needed project. There I was, fairly new to a company, and asked to take the reigns of a project because of limited developer resources. Everyone else was committed to another project, and although I didn&rsquo;t have the expertise to do this on my own, I was the only one around available for the the task at hand.

                  About 8 months ago, I was put on a new project at work. It was a bit of a departure, as I was originally working on an an existing C++/Qt codebase, with other developers who knew the product and could help should I run into any road blocks. This new project, was essentially, to design and implement a brand new web application to store and view primary geo-technical data. There were many obstacles from the very beginning, including architectural design decisions, unclear specifications and requirements, and limited developer resources and experience for the needed project.

                  A few months ago, I had decided to give codeschool a try. It was more out of curiosity than necessity, to see if an online learning tool would help me learn a new language more quickly. Due to a billing hiccup, they were very gracious and gave me a free subscription for 6 months. This is my take on the whole concept: The dizzying highs: Most of the courses give you a good overview of the subject it is trying to educate you on.

                  One of the most influential and interesting projects I have ever had the challenge and pleasure of doing, was organizing the end-of-year exhibition for the Computation Art students. This was several years back, when I was in school, and much younger. I recently decided to update my CV and join the 21st century, so that it can be contained in an online format, and to my dismay, much of the work that went into that project, seems to have been removed/deleted/obliterated.

                  So I found a blog recently about Japanese home cooking, and it seemed intriguing. I am not, by any stretch, an expert but do enjoy cooking from time to time. I&rsquo;ve been trying a few of the recipes, and this is what I have prepared so far: To note, the soy sauce I used was general purpose Kikkoman soy sauce for all the recipes, which is considered a Koikuchi soy sauce and not an Usukuchi (a point I wasn&rsquo;t clear on from the recipes).

                  That&rsquo;s right, you guessed it. This is my first post. What to say, what to say&hellip; Well, first off, if you haven&rsquo;t already noticed, my site is pretty much littered with obscure references to things I love (both geeky and non-geeky alike). There will be more to come. I have a very well thought-out point system, which I am making up as I go along. To the first person to name one of these references, I will award 44012.3 points!
