      <description>No doubt, you have noticed the sparseness of the number of posts on this site. I decided it was time for change, and purged all those articles that no longer sparked joy. Likewise, for my twitter account.
I kept a few that I liked, but most of them went into the recylcing bin. Moving forward, hopefully, I will post more quality content as time moves forward. Or backward. Or twirling towards some abstract goal.</description>

      <description>What you are experiencing is a temporary distortion of reality. Do not be alarmed.
&amp;ndash;Phong
 This site is a little slice of cyberspace that is mine. It is place for me to talk about tech/projects I am working on, and everyday thoughts on life that come up in between coffees.
I made it, all on my own. It may not be glamorous, or even work in some places, but it&amp;rsquo;s still good.</description>

      <title>Doctor Who?</title>

      <description>Ipsum generators for the win&amp;hellip; So while working on the site, I needed some filler text to test. So why not use trusty old lorem ipsum. To my surpise, I discovered many other variations here. And better than that, I found a Doctor Who Ipsum generator.
I was, however, disappointed to see that the Space Ipsum generator site domain seems to have been usurped, and now being used to sell steroids.</description>

      <description>Over the last few months, between work and family time, I have come to the inescapable conclusion that there are not enough hours in a day. And so it goes&amp;hellip;
The Great Experiment: This began when I saw an inspirational article documenting a developer’s 500 day commit streak. At any given time, I always have a laundry list of ideas I’d like to implement and technologies I’d like to experiment with.</description>

      <description>There I was, fairly new to a company, and asked to take the reigns of a project because of limited developer resources. This new project, was essentially, to design and implement a brand new web application to store and view primary geo-technical data. Everyone else was committed to another project, and although I didn’t have the expertise to do this on my own, I was the only one around available for the the task at hand.</description>

      <title>Kanako&#39;s Kitchen</title>

      <description>So I found a blog recently about Japanese home cooking, and it seemed intriguing. I am not, by any stretch, an expert but do enjoy cooking from time to time. I’ve been trying a few of the recipes, and this is what I have prepared so far:
To note, the soy sauce I used was general purpose Kikkoman soy sauce for all the recipes, which is considered a Koikuchi soy sauce and not an Usukuchi (a point I wasn’t clear on from the recipes).</description>

      <description>One of the most influential and interesting projects I have ever had the challenge and pleasure of doing, was organizing the end-of-year exhibition for the Computation Art students. This was several years back, when I was in school, and much younger.
I recently decided to update my CV and join the 21st century, so that it can be contained in an online format, and to my dismay, much of the work that went into that project, seems to have been removed/deleted/obliterated.</description>

      <description>It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness; that is life.
&amp;ndash;Picard
 I am not a ninja, or guru, or rockstar developer.
I am a multi-disciplinary software developer with a wide range of experience. I have seen a lot of things and enjoy learning new tech, but with that comes a price. Am I the authority on a given language/tool? Probably not, but I would guess I could figure it out.</description>
