            <description>No doubt, you have noticed the sparseness of the number of posts on this site. I decided it was time for change, and purged all those articles that no longer sparked joy. Likewise, for my twitter account.
I kept a few that I liked, but most of them went into the recylcing bin. Moving forward, hopefully, I will post more quality content as time moves forward. Or backward. Or twirling towards some abstract goal.</description>

            <description>Ipsum generators for the win&amp;hellip; So while working on the site, I needed some filler text to test. So why not use trusty old lorem ipsum. To my surpise, I discovered many other variations here. And better than that, I found a Doctor Who Ipsum generator.
I was, however, disappointed to see that the Space Ipsum generator site domain seems to have been usurped, and now being used to sell steroids.</description>

<p>So while working on the site, I needed some filler text to test. So why not use trusty old lorem ipsum. To my surpise, I discovered many other variations <a href="https://loremipsum.io/ultimate-list-of-lorem-ipsum-generators/">here</a>. And better than that, I found a <a href="http://doctoripsum.com/">Doctor Who Ipsum generator</a>.</p>
<p>I was, however, disappointed to see that the <a href="https://open.nasa.gov/blog/space-ipsum/">Space Ipsum</a> generator site <a href="http://spaceipsum.com/">domain</a> seems to have been usurped, and now being used to sell steroids.</p>
<p>Anyway, here is a sample&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="tenth">Tenth</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m so sorry. There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They&rsquo;re all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky. Oh, yes. Harmless is just the word: that&rsquo;s why I like it! Doesn&rsquo;t kill, doesn&rsquo;t wound, doesn&rsquo;t maim. But I&rsquo;ll tell you what it does do: it is very good at opening doors! Blimey, trying to make an Ood laugh&hellip; I&rsquo;m the Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle and some string! And look! I&rsquo;m wearing a vegetable!</p>
<p>Black tie&hellip;Whenever I wear this, something bad always happens. Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I&rsquo;ve never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that&rsquo;s rude. Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger. I&rsquo;m Dr. James McCrimmon from the township of Balamory. What? What?! WHAT?! There&rsquo;s something else I&rsquo;ve always wanted to say: Allons-y, Alonso! You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can&rsquo;t spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone. That&rsquo;s the curse of the Time Lords.</p>
<p>Blimey, trying to make an Ood laugh&hellip; Sweet, maybe&hellip; Passionate, I suppose&hellip; But don&rsquo;t ever mistake that for nice. Allons-y! You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can&rsquo;t spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone. That&rsquo;s the curse of the Time Lords. People assume that time is a strict progression of cause-and-effect&hellip; but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it&rsquo;s more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly&hellip; timey-wimey&hellip; stuff. Goodbye&hellip;my Sarah Jane!</p>
<h2 id="twelfth">Twelfth</h2>
<p>You see when I started, all those years ago, I was just running. I called myself the Doctor but it was just a name. Then I went to Skaro. And I met you lot. And I understood who I was. I&rsquo;ve lived for over 2000 years and not all of them have been good. These are attack eyebrows. You could take bottle tops off with these. I&rsquo;m Scottish. I can complain about things now. I can really complain about things now. What do you think of the new look? I was hoping for &lsquo;minimalism&rsquo;, but I think I came up with &lsquo;magician&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. But I&rsquo;d probably blame the English. Come on, Team Not Dead. I don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;m a hugging person now. These are attack eyebrows. You could take bottle tops off with these. No, not the hugging. I&rsquo;m against the hugging. That&rsquo;s a relief. I hate babysitters. Underneath it all I think you&rsquo;re probably kind and nice, and very brave. I just wish you weren&rsquo;t a soldier. You realise one of us is lying about our basic programming. And I think we both know which one that is. Can I talk about planets now?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re very similar heights. Maybe you should wear labels. He was dead already, I&rsquo;m saving us. Follow me, and run! Sorry, I&rsquo;m going to have to relieve you of your pet. Shut up, I was talking to the horse. No. That is not the question. That is not where we start. So you&rsquo;ve got a room for not being awake in. What&rsquo;s the point? You&rsquo;re just missing the room! Come on, Team Not Dead. Old ladies die all the time. It&rsquo;s practically in the job description. What do you think of the new look? I was hoping for &lsquo;minimalism&rsquo;, but I think I came up with &lsquo;magician&rsquo;.</p>

<h2 id="the-great-experiment">The Great Experiment:</h2>
<p>This began when I saw an inspirational article documenting a developer’s <a href="https://drksephy.github.io/2015/07/02/commit/">500 day commit streak</a>. At any given time, I always have a laundry list of ideas I’d like to implement and technologies I’d like to experiment with. Seeing this impressive streak, made me feel as though I was failing as a developer, by not keeping up. Because of this, I decided to try to employ a schedule that would allow me to do some kind of constructive work on a daily basis. At least 1-2 hours of <em>something</em>. My criteria were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>needs to be development-related and constructive (i.e. reading articles involving best practices, coding something, experimenting with some kind of dev-ops tools, strategies/tools to improve personal workflow, etc.)</li>
<li>does not necessarily need to be something ‘committed’ to my github account, so as not to burn myself out</li>
<li>could not interfere with quality time with my family</li>
<li>eventually build something cool with my new and improved skills</li>
</ul>
<p>In the beginning, I was motivated and it wasn’t too difficult. But all good things…</p>
<h2 id="the-kobayashi-maru">The Kobayashi Maru:</h2>
<p>Despite my best efforts, trying to strive to do all that I want while maintaining everything else in my life, proved to be a no-win scenario. There were too many factors I had not taken into consideration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Days where my full-time job needed me to put in some more hours to stay on schedule.</li>
<li>Days where family obligations took more time than expected.</li>
<li>Days where illness zapped me completely, and led me to doing the bare minimum to get the day done.</li>
<li>Days where other interruptions prevented me from getting much needed sleep, completely torpedoing my energy level.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I tried to focus more intently on my goals, other facets of my life suffered. I would skip healthy choices, like going to the gym or getting enough sleep, in order to put in the time needed. I felt those were bad choices.</p>
<p>This whole endeavor showed me a few things. One great thing it helped me with was learning some focus and organizing my time a little better. And although green squares on my github profile are satisfying, they are no substitute for having balance in life. At the end of the day, even with an impressive commit streak, I will not be able to code myself a family or good health. Don’t get me wrong, if I ever reach a point where I can have it all, I’ll go for it (and I applaud those who can achieve this). For now, having it all is not possible.</p>
<p>But, the good news is, I still have been able to find a good balance to create and experiment as much as I need to (instead of as much as I want to). If ever I question my approach, I use this formula to help me re-evaluate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Invention, my dear friends, is 93% perspiration, 6% electricity, 4% evaporation, and 2% butterscotch ripple.</p>
<p>&ndash; Wonka</p>

            <description>There I was, fairly new to a company, and asked to take the reigns of a project because of limited developer resources. This new project, was essentially, to design and implement a brand new web application to store and view primary geo-technical data. Everyone else was committed to another project, and although I didn’t have the expertise to do this on my own, I was the only one around available for the the task at hand.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There I was, fairly new to a company, and asked to take the reigns of a project because of limited developer resources. This new project, was essentially, to design and implement a brand new web application to store and view primary geo-technical data. Everyone else was committed to another project, and although I didn’t have the expertise to do this on my own, I was the only one around available for the the task at hand. It was a bit of a departure, as I was originally working on an an existing C++/Qt codebase with other developers. There were many obstacles from the very beginning, including architectural design decisions, unclear specifications and requirements, and limited experience for the needed project.</p>
<h2 id="the-dizzying-highs">The dizzying highs:</h2>
<p>Our first big challenge was designing what the system should look like, based on the requirements that were somewhat ambiguous at the time. Furthermore, one of the desires of the system was for the user to have complete freedom in designing the geological constructs to store data. This meant, we would have no idea what a “something” would look like until the user created it, and what additional attributes it may have. There was talk of creating database tables as needed, for each new construct. Basically, the user would be a god in the system (or dog, I forget which). This would be problematic. How does one query a database when you have no idea what it looks like? Furthermore, how does a DBA maintain it? How would you adapt software to adapt to the ever-changing data-store?</p>
<p>Our first conclusion was creating tables dynamically, for an unknown number of constructs, would be messy, and likely suicidal. There was a DB paradigm out there that we could possibly use, as a RDBMS didn’t seem ideal for our needs. It was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">No-SQL</a>. We had focused a little on learning <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> and had high hopes for using it (plus, it&rsquo;s <a href="https://youtu.be/b2F-DItXtZs">webscale</a>), but alas, we had no in-house expertise and the timeline for project completion didn’t leave much for gambling on something we knew little about. As an alternative, our database team suggested we use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93attribute%E2%80%93value_model">EAV</a> database design pattern for storing dynamic data within a RDBMS. The only caveat would be we would need to limit the user from creating dynamic constructs, and give them pre-built ones, but general enough so they could design their own templates on top of our core. This was an accepted solution, so we moved forward.</p>
<h2 id="the-terrifying-lows">The terrifying lows:</h2>
<p>Since another web product the company was committed to was already built using PHP and various Microsoft technologies (namely, IIS and SQL Server) due to client imposed restrictions, the trend was that we would develop this new web application with the same technologies.</p>
<p>Using PHP, and the Microsoft colors of the rainbow is not particularly advantageous. They are technologies that do not compliment each other. And as a result, there is very little help and documentation out there in the event you hit a wall. Stick to a solution stack that works well together, like LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) or if Microsoft is your preference, well ASP.NET would be preferable over PHP.</p>
<p>And finally, a client should not be dictating what your software stack is for a cloud-based product, as along as it delivers on the required use-cases. But that is an argument for a another time.</p>
<h2 id="the-creamy-middles">The creamy middles:</h2>
<p>Development resources were something that was lacking on this project. Others assisted where they could, but they were primarily assigned to other projects, and so much of the day-to-day coding was done by myself. Now the main issue with this, was that I was not a web developer by trade, however, due to the circumstances, I became one. I learned as much as I could, and did the best with the what skills I had and what I could learn from the only other web developer in the company. I learned a great deal, which is one of the pluses when thrown into a situation as this, but most days I felt like <a href="https://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/234/765/b7e.jpg">this</a>. Also, I am certain that had there been more experienced web developers throughout the development of the project, certain steps could have been achieved more quickly.</p>
<p>In the end, it turned out better than I had expected, but there is still much to be done in the next phases of QA, deployment, and maintenance.</p>

            <title>Kanako&#39;s Kitchen</title>
            <link>https://quandrei.com/posts/2013/10/kanakos-kitchen/</link>

            <description>So I found a blog recently about Japanese home cooking, and it seemed intriguing. I am not, by any stretch, an expert but do enjoy cooking from time to time. I’ve been trying a few of the recipes, and this is what I have prepared so far:
To note, the soy sauce I used was general purpose Kikkoman soy sauce for all the recipes, which is considered a Koikuchi soy sauce and not an Usukuchi (a point I wasn’t clear on from the recipes).</description>

<p>To note, the soy sauce I used was general purpose Kikkoman soy sauce for all the recipes, which is considered a Koikuchi soy sauce and not an Usukuchi (a point I wasn’t clear on from the recipes).</p>
<p><a href="https://japanesekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/07/30/hakusai-tuna-nimono/">Hakusai and tuna fish nimono</a>: This is a very simple and easy recipe that came out really well. Easy for any newbie, nice flavor, and good in a pinch, but I think I would have preferred it with minced pork. Will definitely be trying this one again.</p>
<p><a href="https://japanesekitchen.wordpress.com/2010/07/19/saba-nitsuke/">Saba Nitsuke</a>: This was also a great dish. Although, since I was using 4 filets of mackerel instead of the 2 in the recipe, I doubled the portions for the sauce. I don’t think this was necessary in the end, as I had way too much sauce while simmering the fish, and had a hard time reducing it to an acceptable thickness. It was still quite tasty, just wasted ingredients is all.</p>
<p><a href="https://japanesekitchen.wordpress.com/2010/07/22/yakinasu/">Yakinasu</a>: I love eggplants. And this recipe had promise, but I don’t think I executed very well. Fairly simple, but takes patience and time. I only used the katsuobushi as a seasoning, and skipped the ginger. Also, because we were eating several dishes at once, and I had made a plate for each person, I forgot to put some soy sauce on the side for seasoning, which I think would’ve complimented this quite well. Overall, the dish was very smokey, and nice, but I felt lacked something to compliment the smokiness. Again, likely due to the absence of soy sauce.</p>
<p><a href="https://japanesekitchen.wordpress.com/2009/11/16/nuta/">Nuta</a>: I used “white” miso paste for this recipe, but can use whichever you prefer. It was quite good, but due to other cooking distractions, I overcooked the green onions slightly. Still quite tasty, and complimented the above mackerel nicely.</p>
<p>As with most dishes, I served all of these with Japanese white rice. I highly recommend reading on how to prepare it, because having mediocre rice can really spoil a meal.</p>
<p>Will continue to go through these, and I suggest you do too. Lots to discover on this blog!</p>

            <description>One of the most influential and interesting projects I have ever had the challenge and pleasure of doing, was organizing the end-of-year exhibition for the Computation Art students. This was several years back, when I was in school, and much younger.
I recently decided to update my CV and join the 21st century, so that it can be contained in an online format, and to my dismay, much of the work that went into that project, seems to have been removed/deleted/obliterated.</description>

<p>I recently decided to update my CV and join the 21st century, so that it can be contained in an online format, and to my dismay, much of the work that went into that project, seems to have been removed/deleted/obliterated. All I can find remaining online, is a <a href="http://newmediafix.net/daily/?p=1967">press release</a> on some website. The page that contained this archive still <a href="http://exposed.concordia.ca/">exists</a>, but has been revamped to hold my successors’ organization of their show. No mention of archives, or past shows. As if nothing my team had achieved mattered. We pioneered that society, and built enough resources for them to continue for years to come, and all we had done… gone. Disappointing.</p>
<p>I still have some of the print media (hard copy… I know, I know), but it is still a shame that many of the interesting projects are no longer chronicled online.</p>
<p>Just need to get that off my chest. I’m done now. Carry on.</p>

 I am not a ninja, or guru, or rockstar developer.
I am a multi-disciplinary software developer with a wide range of experience. I have seen a lot of things and enjoy learning new tech, but with that comes a price. Am I the authority on a given language/tool? Probably not, but I would guess I could figure it out.</description>

Am I the authority on a given language/tool? Probably not, but I would guess I could figure it out. My greatest asset, is that I can adapt to new settings and challenges. Tinkering with new technology is what excites me about my domain, but always making sure I am solving problems and providing quality/value, is what drives me.</p>
<p>Subjects that interest me in my industry are DevOps, security, IaC, and automation.</p>
<p>Interests outside my developer gig, you will probably be able to deduce by poking around some of my posts. Hope you enjoy the trip.</p>
