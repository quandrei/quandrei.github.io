      <description>It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness; that is life.

 I am not a ninja, or guru, or rockstar developer.
I am a multi-disciplinary software developer with a wide range of experience. I have seen a lot of things and enjoy learning new tech, but with that comes a price. Am I the authority on a given language/tool? Probably not, but I would guess I could figure it out.</description>
