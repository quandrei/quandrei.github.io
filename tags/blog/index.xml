      <title>Github Pages Launch</title>

&lt;p&gt;So the process was slow­moving (due to a few other things going on in my life), but it is finally up and running. A few things to take note of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;deciding-on-a-jekyll-theme:2c26a5b1b5753de0d42116532c98c907&#34;&gt;Deciding on a Jekyll theme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was more challenging than I thought. There are quite a few out there, but I decided on one that was simple, and looked slick, namely, &lt;a href=&#34;http://getpoole.com/&#34;&gt;Poole&lt;/a&gt; (the Jekyll butler) using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://lanyon.getpoole.com/&#34;&gt;Lanyon&lt;/a&gt; theme. &lt;a href=&#34;http://hyde.getpoole.com/&#34;&gt;Hyde&lt;/a&gt; was a close second, but I preferred having the hidden menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-css-is-a-bit-buggy:2c26a5b1b5753de0d42116532c98c907&#34;&gt;The CSS is a bit buggy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does not seem to be completely cross­browser friendly. I noticed that clicking on the menu icon (top­right) in FF will still have the icon super­imposed on the text, whereas in other browsers, it will move left when displaying the menu (as it should). When using a fresh Jekyll install locally, with no content changed, this is not the case, but as soon as I changed something, it broke for some reason. It&amp;rsquo;s possible I borked something somewhere, but haven&amp;rsquo;t looked into it much. Funny enough, it works nicely on my Nexus 4 using the FF browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;moving-content:2c26a5b1b5753de0d42116532c98c907&#34;&gt;Moving Content&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this was a little dull as I needed to grab the raw content from my SS site, and format it for markdown. SS doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an API I&amp;rsquo;m aware of for such a task (although I didn&amp;rsquo;t look into it much), and I probably could&amp;rsquo;ve written a script for this, but I would&amp;rsquo;ve needed to go through the content anyway to ensure everything was pristine. The script would&amp;rsquo;ve likely taken more time than actually going through the few blog posts I had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-few-nice-things:2c26a5b1b5753de0d42116532c98c907&#34;&gt;A few nice things&amp;hellip;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few easily­ done things I liked about SS. One was having a tag cloud, which requires some plugin for Jekyll. Not sure if having a plugin is something I could do on Github Pages, so I would need to look into it. Another, was having a gallery of some photography I did in a past life. Again, a plugin is the likely route, and not sure if gh­pages blah blah blah&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;­­­&amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s it. As a treat, I think everyone should read this: &lt;a href=&#34;http://chiefobrienatwork.com/&#34;&gt;Chief O&amp;rsquo;Brien at Work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Github Pages Transition</title>
      <link>http://quandrei.github.io/post/github-pages-transition/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://quandrei.github.io/post/github-pages-transition/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to make the transition from SquareSpace to &lt;a href=&#34;http://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;github pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons for this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gh-pages is available for the low, bargain-basement price of free as opposed to SS costing money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gh-pages allows me to version-control my site &amp;ndash; being an avid developer, this appeals to me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gh-pages has the basic features I need &amp;ndash; all I really do is put up links to my projects and blog, and gh-pages allows me to do this easily. SS offers many more features, like e-commerce, but when unused, seems silly to pay for them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the longer I stay with SS, the more difficult it will be to move away from them (i.e. move my content somewhere else, if I ever wish to leave)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the UI in SS seems to be a bit more cumbersome lately, and is starting to annoy me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be moving my content gradually to my new digs: &lt;a href=&#34;http://quandrei.github.io/&#34;&gt;quandrei.github.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[End transmission]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
