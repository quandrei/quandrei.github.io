      <description>One of the most influential and interesting projects I have ever had the challenge and pleasure of doing, was organizing the end-of-year exhibition for the Computation Art students. This was several years back, when I was in school, and much younger.
I recently decided to update my CV and join the 21st century, so that it can be contained in an online format, and to my dismay, much of the work that went into that project, seems to have been removed/deleted/obliterated.</description>
