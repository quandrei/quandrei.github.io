            	I started writing a trivial bookmarking app in Python / Flask for the main purpose of learning that stack. I must say that it was informative and fun. The dizzying highs: Writing something in Python, with its simple and clean syntax, was satisfying. Little verbosity, and getting the logic I needed into classes and organized accordingly, was not a big hurdle. The microframework, Flask, did a good job of staying out of my way, and giving me what I needed when defining my routes.

            	This is minor rant really, but I have been mildly annoyed with my domain registrar, Hover, recently. Several months ago, I inquired whether I would be able to pay in CAD, instead of being charged in USD (and then having my credit card company add a surcharge due to foreign currency conversion). I thought this would be a trivial and easy request to grant since they are a Canadian company, and I am a Canadian citizen, and it would stand to reason we could do business using our nation&rsquo;s legitimate currency.

            	PHP, we all fall down So PHP has been getting me down lately, and I have been looking for the next new thing to get my mojo rising. Despite some improvements that came out of PHP7 and dependency tools like Composer, there are a great many things that make day-to-day development, well, annoying. Among them, they include: an identity crisis, where it adopts the verbosity of Java in many of its bloated frameworks, but also retains its procedural style from its C-like hay day a lack of types, causing unpredictability and a debugging nightmare natural assumptions regarding built in functions seem to take a holiday the fact that its used considerably on the web, and everybody&rsquo;s cousin is learning just enough to be dangerous, I often encounter terrible code I have the pleasure of supporting/maintaining Wordpress and Drupal If &ldquo;Why PHP sucks&rdquo; is a topic that interests you, some fair points can be found here and here.

            	In my endeavor to not be bored, and learn new things, I decided to take a step in a new direction, and move my existing Jekyll blog to Hugo. Why hugo? There seem to be some obvious advantages out there for using Hugo over Jekyll, but the following reasons are what sold me on the idea: an excuse to learn me a great good; specifically get started on go-lang KISS principle performance boost from Jekyll (there are numerous articles out there, take your pick) taxonomy implememtation was dead-simple with a decent theme (lacking in my previous blog version) easy migration from Jekyll easily hosted on github pages --watch and --theme=theme_name options when running locally, which are incredibly useful for dynamically observing changes to the site, and testing/vetting out themes Searching for a theme: There were a few interesting themes I was debating on, and here were a few of the front-runners: lanyon-hugo: I felt like I needed something different than my old blog, so this was out casper: was not too keen on the menu layout and the blog rendering, and no categories detox: no tag filtering for blog posts, no categories startbootstrap-clean-blog: too many errors to count, didn&rsquo;t work out of the box purehugo: this was a close second, but there was little documentation for setting defaults for things like social networks, and I did not like the fact that the entire blog post is output on the posts page (should be a partial preview imho) Since I am not the type to waste time wrangling HTML/CSS, and wanted to get something ported quickly, I finally decided on redlounge.

            	So I have been extraordinarily busy with work these past few months, and haven&rsquo;t had very much time for side projects, and interesting things that I&rsquo;ve wanted to devote some time to. I&rsquo;ve also been getting pretty bored with the work I am doing, something very dangerous in my profession, since this usually leads to the itch for new surroundings. This is a fairly engaging read on how to combat boredom for employees: Bored People Quit In an effort to combat my boredom, I have been devoting time to learning a few new things: Dokku - PAAS (mini-Heroku) I deployed to my VPS to host everything Python / Flask - python microframework used to create a web app Go / Hugo - golang site generator to provide info on various projects Swift - iOS app to interface with the web app API I will update here, once more of these developments have materialized.

            	About 8 months ago, I was put on a new project at work. It was a bit of a departure, as I was originally working on an an existing C++/Qt codebase, with other developers who knew the product and could help should I run into any road blocks. This new project, was essentially, to design and implement a brand new web application to store and view primary geo-technical data. There were many obstacles from the very beginning, including architectural design decisions, unclear specifications and requirements, and limited developer resources and experience for the needed project.
